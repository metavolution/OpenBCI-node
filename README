The system is designed to process, visualize and feedback 
multiple channels of brainwave data 
correlated to collective neural firing patterns, 
to allow the user to reshape neuron connections in the brain 
through visual, auditory and haptic feedback stimuli and brainwave entrainment.


The changes in brain and consciousness depend on the type of neurofeedback training setup, 
and the method of feedback stimulating the subconscious reward circuitry of the brain. 

With 4-10 training sessions it is usually possible to learn to consciously control mental states, 
learn to stimulate or reduce brainwave activity in brain-areas, 
bring multiple areas into synchroneous activity, 
stimulating inter-neuron connectivity 
and enhancing mental abilities, perception, and consciousness.

Some scientific studies show, 
that in four 15-minute sessions most people can 
learn to reduce brainwave activity in the pain-perception-center or reduce depression.

General effects are usually increased ability to self-control mental state (relaxation / focus), 
as well as changes in sleeping, dreaming, meditation and learning states.
